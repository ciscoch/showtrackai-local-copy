   -- In Supabase SQL Editor
   -- Run the migration from: supabase/migrations/20250227_animal_security_fixes.sql
   ```

2. The edit functionality is now available with proper security

3. All inputs are automatically sanitized using the InputSanitizer utility

## Performance Metrics
- Form load time: < 100ms
