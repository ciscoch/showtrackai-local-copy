## üöÄ Quick Start Testing

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /Users/francisco/Documents/CALUDE/showtrackai-local-copy
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Run the App Locally
```bash
# Run in Chrome with hot reload
flutter run -d chrome --web-port=8080

# Or run in release mode for better performance
flutter run -d chrome --web-port=8080 --release
```

### 3. Navigate to Journal Entry Form
1. Open app in browser: `http://localhost:8080`
2. Navigate to Journal section
3. Click "Add Journal Entry" or similar button

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: GPS Location Capture
1. **Enable Location:**
   - Toggle "Use GPS location" switch
   - Browser will prompt for permission
   - Click "Allow" to grant permission

2. **Expected Results:**
   - Loading spinner appears
   - GPS coordinates captured
   - Address reverse geocoded and displayed
   - Weather data fetched and shown
   - Green success box shows location details

3. **What You'll See:**
   ```
   ‚úì Location Captured
   [Your Address]
   GPS: 37.123456, -122.123456
   Accuracy: ¬±10m
   
   ‚òÅÔ∏è Weather Conditions
   22.5¬∞C / 72.5¬∞F
   Partly cloudy
   Humidity: 65%
   Wind: 3.2 m/s
   ```

### Scenario 2: Manual Location Name
1. **Add Custom Name:**
   - After capturing GPS location
   - Enter name like "Barn A" or "North Pasture"
   - Name is saved with GPS coordinates

2. **Manual Only:**
   - Don't toggle GPS
   - Just type location name
   - No GPS or weather captured

### Scenario 3: Permission Denied
1. **Deny Permission:**
   - Toggle GPS location
   - Click "Block" on permission prompt

2. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Error message displays
   - Falls back to manual entry
   - User can still enter location name

### Scenario 4: Weather API Testing

#### Without API Key (Default):
- Returns sample weather data
- Rotates through 5 realistic weather conditions
- Good for UI testing

#### With API Key:
1. Get free key at: https://openweathermap.org/api
2. Update `lib/services/weather_service.dart`:
   ```dart
   static const String _apiKey = 'your_actual_api_key_here';
   ```
3. Real weather data will be fetched

## üîç Chrome DevTools Testing

### Simulate Different Locations
1. **Open DevTools:** Press F12
2. **Navigate to Sensors:**
   - Click ‚ãÆ (three dots) ‚Üí More tools ‚Üí Sensors
3. **Override Location:**
   - Select preset city or enter custom coordinates
   - Examples:
     - San Francisco: 37.7749, -122.4194
     - Des Moines, IA: 41.5868, -93.6250
     - Austin, TX: 30.2672, -97.7431

### Test Different Scenarios
- **No GPS Signal:** Select "Location unavailable"
- **Different Cities:** Use preset locations
- **Rural Areas:** Enter farm coordinates

## üìù Sample Test Data

### Location Names
- "Barn A - West Wing"
- "North Pasture"
- "Show Arena - Ring 3"
- "Feed Storage Building"
- "Veterinary Examination Area"

### Test Descriptions (50+ words)
```
"Today I worked with the Holstein heifer on halter training in 
the north pasture. The weather was ideal for training, with 
moderate temperatures and low humidity. She responded well to 
gentle pressure and voice commands. We practiced walking, 
stopping, and setting up for show position. The session lasted 
thirty minutes and showed significant improvement from yesterday's 
training session."
```

## üö¶ Ready for Testing!

The geolocation feature is fully implemented and ready for local testing. No database changes or n8n modifications required. All functionality works in the browser using real GPS and weather data (or sample data for offline testing).

### Next Steps After Testing
1. Gather user feedback
2. Adjust UI/UX based on testing
3. Add unit tests
4. Consider offline caching strategies
5. Plan for mobile platform support
