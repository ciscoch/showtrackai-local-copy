# Netlify Flutter Build Error Fixes

## Problem Analysis

The "Expected to find project root in current working directory" error occurs when Flutter commands are executed from the wrong directory. This happens because:

1. **Directory Navigation Issues**: The build script changes directories but doesn't consistently ensure Flutter commands run from the Flutter project root
2. **Missing Project Root Validation**: No explicit verification that `pubspec.yaml` exists before running Flutter commands  
3. **Inconsistent Working Directory**: Flutter commands were being run from different locations throughout the script

## Root Cause

Flutter identifies a project root by looking for `pubspec.yaml`. The error occurs at Line 233 because:
- `flutter pub get` was being run from a directory that doesn't contain `pubspec.yaml`
- The script installed Flutter but didn't ensure all subsequent commands ran from the project directory
- Directory context was lost during the build process

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Project Root Detection & Validation**
```bash
# Ensure we're in the correct directory and find project root
PROJECT_ROOT=""
if [ -n "$NETLIFY_REPO_PATH" ] && [ -d "$NETLIFY_REPO_PATH" ]; then
    PROJECT_ROOT="$NETLIFY_REPO_PATH"
elif [ -d "/opt/build/repo" ]; then
    PROJECT_ROOT="/opt/build/repo"
else
    PROJECT_ROOT="$(pwd)"
fi

echo "üìç Project root: $PROJECT_ROOT"
cd "$PROJECT_ROOT"

# Verify we're in a Flutter project directory
if [ ! -f "pubspec.yaml" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå ERROR: pubspec.yaml not found in $PROJECT_ROOT"
    echo "Directory contents:"
    ls -la
    exit 1
fi
```

### 2. **Consistent Directory Context**
Every Flutter command now explicitly ensures it's running from the project root:
```bash
# Before every Flutter command:
cd "$PROJECT_ROOT"  # Ensure we're in project root
flutter [command]
```

### 3. **Enhanced Debugging Output**
Added explicit logging to track directory context:
```bash
echo "üìç Running 'flutter pub get' from: $(pwd)"
echo "üìç Running Flutter build from: $(pwd)"
```

### 4. **Flutter Binary Path Verification**
```bash
FLUTTER_BIN="$(pwd)/flutter/bin"
export PATH="$FLUTTER_BIN:$PATH"

# Verify Flutter installation
if [ ! -f "$FLUTTER_BIN/flutter" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå ERROR: Flutter binary not found at $FLUTTER_BIN/flutter"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Files Modified

### Primary Build Script: `netlify-build-fixed.sh`
- ‚úÖ Added project root detection and validation
- ‚úÖ Added `pubspec.yaml` existence check
- ‚úÖ Ensured all Flutter commands run from project root
- ‚úÖ Added directory context logging
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling and debugging

### Backup Build Script: `build_for_netlify.sh`
- ‚úÖ Applied same fixes for consistency
- ‚úÖ Maintained compatibility with different Flutter versions
- ‚úÖ Added same directory validation logic

## Key Improvements

### **Before Fix:**
```bash
flutter pub get  # Could run from any directory
```

### **After Fix:**
```bash
cd "$PROJECT_ROOT"
echo "üìç Running 'flutter pub get' from: $(pwd)"
flutter pub get  # Always runs from project root
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Project Root Validation**: Script now exits early if `pubspec.yaml` not found
2. **Directory Logging**: Clear output shows which directory each command runs from  
3. **Flutter Binary Check**: Verifies Flutter installation before attempting to use it
4. **Consistent Context**: Every Flutter command preceded by `cd "$PROJECT_ROOT"`

## Expected Build Output

With these fixes, you should see output like:
```
üìç Project root: /opt/build/repo
‚úÖ Flutter project root confirmed: /opt/build/repo
üì¶ pubspec.yaml found
üîß Flutter binary path: /opt/build/repo/flutter/bin
üìç Running 'flutter pub get' from: /opt/build/repo
üìç Running Flutter build from: /opt/build/repo
```

## Error Prevention

The fixes prevent these common Flutter build errors:
- ‚ùå "Expected to find project root in current working directory"
- ‚ùå "Could not find a file named 'pubspec.yaml'"  
- ‚ùå "No pubspec.yaml file found"
- ‚ùå "Flutter SDK not found in PATH"

## Testing

Use the test script `test-netlify-build-fixes.sh` to verify the fixes work correctly before deploying to Netlify.
