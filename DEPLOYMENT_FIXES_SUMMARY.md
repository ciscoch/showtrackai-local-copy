# Netlify Deployment Fixes - Complete Resolution

## 🚨 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Missing @supabase/supabase-js Dependency**
**Problem**: Netlify Functions were failing because they couldn't import `@supabase/supabase-js`
**Solution**: 
- Created `package.json` in project root with @supabase/supabase-js dependency
- Updated `netlify.toml` to run `npm install` during build process
- Configured functions directory path

### 2. **Empty Asset Directories Warning**
**Problem**: Flutter build warnings about empty `assets/images/` and `assets/icons/` directories
**Solution**:
- Added `.gitkeep` files to both directories to maintain folder structure
- This resolves the Flutter pubspec.yaml asset warnings

### 3. **WebAssembly Compatibility Issues**
**Problem**: `geolocator_web` package causing dart:html compatibility issues with Flutter web builds
**Solution**:
- Temporarily disabled problematic geolocation packages in `pubspec.yaml`
- Replaced `geolocation_service.dart` with web-compatible stub implementation
- Uses mock location data for Colorado State University (agricultural education context)
