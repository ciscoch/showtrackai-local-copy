# Feature Planning Request

## Goal
APP-123: Auth screen + Supabase email sign-in - Add sign-up functionality

## Current Project Structure
This is a Flutter ShowTrackAI app for agricultural education with the following structure:
- lib/main.dart - Main application entry
- lib/services/ - Business logic and API services
- lib/widgets/ - Reusable UI components
- lib/screens/ - Screen/page components
- lib/models/ - Data models
- test/ - Test files

## Planning Requirements
Please break down this goal into 5-7 thin vertical slices that can be implemented incrementally. Each slice should:
1. Be independently testable
2. Provide visible user value
3. Build upon the previous slice
4. Take 1-3 hours to implement

For each slice, provide:
- Brief description
- Key files to create/modify
- Testing approach
- Success criteria

## Output Format
Please structure your response as:

### Slice 1: [Title]
**Description:** [What this slice accomplishes]
**Files:** [Key files to create/modify]
**Tests:** [How to test this slice]
**Success:** [When this slice is complete]

[Continue for all slices...]
