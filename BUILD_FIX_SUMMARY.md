# Flutter Build Error Fix - Summary

## Problem Solved
**Error**: `Expected to find project root in current working directory.` on Line 233

## Root Cause
Flutter commands were not consistently running from the directory containing `pubspec.yaml`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Project Root Detection**
```bash
# Find and validate project root
PROJECT_ROOT=""
if [ -n "$NETLIFY_REPO_PATH" ] && [ -d "$NETLIFY_REPO_PATH" ]; then
    PROJECT_ROOT="$NETLIFY_REPO_PATH"
elif [ -d "/opt/build/repo" ]; then
    PROJECT_ROOT="/opt/build/repo"
else
    PROJECT_ROOT="$(pwd)"
fi

cd "$PROJECT_ROOT"

# Validate Flutter project
if [ ! -f "pubspec.yaml" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå ERROR: pubspec.yaml not found"
    exit 1
fi
```

### 2. **Consistent Directory Context**
Every Flutter command now runs from the project root:
```bash
cd "$PROJECT_ROOT"  # Ensure correct location
flutter pub get     # Will find pubspec.yaml

cd "$PROJECT_ROOT"  # Ensure correct location  
flutter build web   # Will find project files
```

### 3. **Enhanced Debugging**
Added directory tracking throughout the build process:
```bash
echo "üìç Running 'flutter pub get' from: $(pwd)"
echo "üìç Running Flutter build from: $(pwd)"
```

## Files Updated
- ‚úÖ `netlify-build-fixed.sh` - Primary build script
- ‚úÖ `build_for_netlify.sh` - Backup build script
- ‚úÖ Both scripts now have identical directory handling logic

## Verification Results
‚úÖ All tests passed:
- Project root detection works correctly
- pubspec.yaml validation prevents errors
- Directory context is preserved for all Flutter commands
- Build scripts are executable and ready for deployment

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy to Netlify** - The build should now complete successfully
2. **Monitor Logs** - Watch for the new directory tracking messages
3. **Verify Success** - Build should complete without the Line 233 error

**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for Deployment  
**Confidence Level**: High - Comprehensive testing completed
