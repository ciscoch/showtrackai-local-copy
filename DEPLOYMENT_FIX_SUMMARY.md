## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Duplicate Import Error**
- **Problem**: `LocationData` and `WeatherData` were imported from both `journal_entry.dart` and `location_weather.dart`
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate import of `location_weather.dart` since it re-exports from `journal_entry.dart`
- **File**: `lib/screens/journal_entry_form_page.dart`

### 2. **Method Call Errors**
- **Problem**: `AnimalService.getUserAnimals` was called as static but it's an instance method
- **Solution**: Changed to `AnimalService().getAnimals()` 
- **Files**: 
  - `lib/screens/journal_entry_form_page.dart`
  - `lib/screens/journal_list_page.dart`

### 3. **Icon Reference Error**
- **Problem**: `Icons.target` doesn't exist in Flutter
- **Solution**: Already fixed in code (was not present in current version)

### 4. **LocationData Constructor**
- **Problem**: LocationData was called with incorrect parameters
- **Solution**: Updated all LocationData instantiations to match constructor
- **Files**:
  - `lib/services/geolocation_service.dart`
  - `lib/widgets/location_input_field.dart`

### 5. **Test File Updates**
- **Problem**: Test files had incorrect method calls
- **Solution**: Updated to use proper static/instance methods
- **File**: `test/widget/journal_entry_form_test.dart`
